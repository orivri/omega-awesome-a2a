## Original Analysis
VideoPoet represents a fundamental shift in video synthesis by reimagining video generation through the lens of language modeling, utilizing a decoder-only transformer architecture that can process multiple input modalities seamlessly. Unlike approaches that treat video generation as a specialized task, VideoPoet's architecture follows the successful paradigm of Large Language Models, employing a two-stage approach of pretraining and task-specific adaptation that enables zero-shot generalization across various video synthesis tasks. The model's ability to maintain temporal coherence while generating high-fidelity motions demonstrates its potential as a foundation model for video generation, marking a significant advancement in multimodal AI systems.

## Technical Innovation
- Decoder-only transformer architecture for multimodal processing
- Unified vocabulary across text, video, and audio modalities
- Two-stage training protocol (pretraining + task adaptation)
- Zero-shot capabilities for various video generation tasks

## Implementation Details
```python
class VideoPoet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.token_vocabulary = MultiModalVocabulary(
            visual_tokens=8192,
            audio_tokens=1024,
            text_tokens=50257
        )
        self.transformer = DecoderOnlyTransformer(
            num_layers=24,
            hidden_dim=2048,
            num_heads=32
        )
    
    def generate_video(self, prompt, num_frames=64):
        # Initialize with prompt tokens
        tokens = self.tokenize_input(prompt, modality='text')
        
        # Autoregressive generation
        for frame_idx in range(num_frames):
            next_tokens = self.transformer.generate(
                context=tokens,
                temperature=0.8,
                top_k=50
            )
            tokens = self.update_sequence(tokens, next_tokens)
            
        return self.decode_to_video(tokens)
