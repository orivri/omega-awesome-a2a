## LLaVA-Plus: Multimodal Tool-Using Agent

**Paper**: [LLaVA-Plus: Learning to Use Tools for Creating Multimodal Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05437)

**Key Innovation**: LLaVA-Plus introduces a novel approach to multimodal AI by creating an agent that can dynamically use external tools and pre-trained models as skills, while maintaining visual context throughout the interaction. This represents a significant advancement in agent-to-agent systems by demonstrating how multimodal models can compose multiple tools for complex task completion.

**Why It Matters for A2A**: This work is foundational for A2A systems as it shows how agents can:
1. Maintain visual context while using multiple tools
2. Dynamically select and compose different skills
3. Ground tool usage in visual understanding

**Implementation Notes**:
```python
# Example architecture for tool integration
class MultimodalToolAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_model = "LLaVA-13B"
        self.tool_repository = {
            "visual_qa": VisualQAModel(),
            "image_edit": ImageEditTool(),
            "knowledge_retrieval": KnowledgeBase()
        }
    
    def process_query(self, image, text, available_tools):
        context = self.maintain_visual_context(image)
        selected_tools = self.tool_selector(context, text)
        return self.compose_tool_outputs(selected_tools)
